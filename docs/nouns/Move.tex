    \item Moving a chip adds it at a new point and removes it from its initial point.
    \item Moving to a blot causes the opposing playerâ€™s chip to move to the bar.
    \item Chips cannot be moved to a point occupied by more than 1 of the opponent's chips.
    \item Chips move a number of points equal to the value of the die.
    \item Assigning multiple moves to the same chip requires that all the individual moves are legal.
    \item If a player has no valid moves, then that player's turn ends.

\noindent{\newline\textbf{Move} Chips are moved according to the number on each die after the roll. Chips can be moved to empty points or points occupied that player's own chips without restrictions. Chips can also be moved to points occupied by no more than 1 of the opponents chips, a move called a blot, which causes the opponents chip to move to the bar. Multiple moves can be assigned to the same chips, but it requires that all the individual moves are legal.}

\subsection{Summary}
Move will give rise to behaviours in Board.
