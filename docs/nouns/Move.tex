\noindent{\newline\textbf{Move} Chips are moved according to the number on each die after the roll. Chips can be moved to empty points or points occupied that player's own chips without restrictions. Chips can also be moved to points occupied by no more than 1 of the opponents chips, a move called a blot, which causes the opponents chip to move to the bar. Multiple moves can be assigned to the same chips, but it requires that all the individual moves are legal.}
