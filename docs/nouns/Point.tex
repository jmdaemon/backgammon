\newline \textbf{Point} - A series of triangles alternating in
colour that chips can be placed on. Points can only hold chips
of a single colour at a time, but there is no limit to the number
of chips they can hold. A point occupied by more than 1 of the
opposing player's chips is locked and cannot be moved to.
