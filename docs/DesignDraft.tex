\chapter{Introduction}

This is an initial draft for a CPSC 101 for the Winter 2022 semester by Team Decaffeinators
with Joseph Diza as the lead author and developer.  \\

\noindent
This document gives a quick \& extremely simplified overview
of the actual API and design of the Backgammon game.

\chapter{Noun Entries}

\section{Die}

\subsection{Facts}

\begin{dashed}
    \item There are two die in play in a game.
    \item At the start of the game, both players roll to determine who goes first.
The player with the higher roll plays first, and the dice are re-rolled if equal.
    \item Players move their chips according to the rolls on their dice.
        E.g Player rolls 2,5 he can choose to move one piece up 2, and another up 5,
        or one piece for a combined movement of 7 points.
    \item If the player rolls the same number on both dice, he "gets doubles", which
        allows him to play each die twice.
        E.g Player rolls 6,6 now he has 4 sixes that he can play.

\end{dashed}

\subsection{Summary}

A single Die does not contain much information to warrant becoming a class (the
only useful method for a single Die would be to generate a random integer).

\section{Doubling Cube}

\subsection{Facts}

\begin{dashed}
    \item The doubling cube controls the stakes of the game.
    \item Games begin with a stake of one, the doubling cube may be used by either player.
    \item Players at the start their turns may propose to double the stakes of the game
        with the doubling cube, the opponent can accept the stakes refuse, forcing them
        to concede the game at the current stakes.
    \item The doubling cube multiplies the stakes of the winner at the end of the game.
\end{dashed}

\subsection{Attributes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Die Faces (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Behaviors}

\begin{itemize}
    \item double
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collaborations}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item multiplier is used in Score
\end{itemize}

\section{Score}

\subsection{Facts}

\begin{dashed}
    \item The points that you score for a match are determined by the type of win you achieve.
    \item A normal win requires you bear off all your chips, or that the other player concedes. This awards one point
    \item A Gammon win requires you win before the other player manages to bear off any chips. This awards 2 points
    \item A Backgammon requires you meet the prior requirements and the enemy player still has chips on your home quadrant or the bar. This awards 3 points.
    \item The points you are awarded are multiplied by the value of the doubling cube.
\end{dashed}

\subsection{Summary}
The doubling cube is a multiplier that determines the number of points awarded
to the winner at the end of a game.

\section{Point}

\subsection{Facts}

\begin{dashed}
    \item There are 24 points total on the board.
    \item Every point can hold 6 checkers.
    \item There are 12 points on the outer board, and 12 on the home board.
    \item A checker may only move to a point if it is open (contains < 2 opponents chips
        or < 6 of the player's chips)
\end{dashed}

\subsection{Summary}

A point at the very least needs to be some kind of container that has the ability
to store checkers. It also needs to determine how many checkers are on a point.

\section{Player}

\subsection{Facts}

\begin{dashed}
    \item There are two players in a game.
    \item The player can make a series of moves
\end{dashed}

\section{Chip}

\subsection{Facts}
\begin{dashed}
	\item Moves clockwise based on dice (from player home quadrant).
	\item Allowed to choose which chip to move.
	\item Not allowed to move to a position where there are already 2 enemy chips.
	\item Allowed to land on a position where there is only one enemy chip, doing so
      removes that enemy chip and relocates it to the bar.
	\item Removed chips must be played next, they are played from the most
      counterclockwise position (the enemy home quadrant).
	\item If no moves are available, player pass.
	\item Each player has 15 chips
\end{dashed}

\subsection{Attributes}
\begin{dashed}
	\item Chips come in 2 colors (red \& white)
\end{dashed}

\subsection{Summary}
Due to the need to keep track of the chip location, a method maybe needed to update how many chips
are on a pointer.

\section{Bar}

\subsection{Facts}
\begin{dashed}
	\item Holds chips that have been "eaten" by player
	\item If a player has one or more pieces on the bar,
	 no other pieces can be moved until all such pieces
	 have re-entered play.
\end{dashed}

\subsubsection{Attributes}
\begin{dashed}
	\item Holds chips of either color(Black or White)
\end{dashed}
